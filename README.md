# Airdrop Eligibility Checker Agent
This Python-based async agent is designed to swiftly check a given Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) address for token airdrop eligibility across multiple blockchain networks and smart contracts simultaneously.

Built using the **Sentient Agent Framework**  
https://github.com/sentient-agi/Sentient-Agent-Framework

## Key Features
- Multi-Chain Support: Easily configured to query eligibility on various EVM-compatible chains (e.g., Arbitrum, Linea) using Etherscan/Arbiscan/Lineascan proxy APIs.

- ABI-Driven Calls

- Asynchronous Performance

- Configuration via YAML: Contract addresses, methods, and ABIs are easily managed in a centralized YAML file (contracts.yml).
